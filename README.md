## Name
wordle bot

## Description
A bot to solve wordle puzzles

## Usage - Version with GUI
-Navigate to the "dist" folder and launch the .exe
--Disclaimer: The "answer" version will likely solve the Wordle much faster than the "guess" version as the "answer" version is supplied with only possible right answers while the "guess" version is supplied with every possible legal guess making for much more processing per round.

-Enter your first guess against the wordle website and observe the returned color of each letter

-Enter your guess into the window, one letter into each edit box to reproduce your guess.

-Click the "change color" buttons under each entered letter until the colors match the returned colors on the wordle website

-Click "submit", it may pause for a short duration while computing

-Repeat until word is identified, the bot will populate the recommended guess after each submission


## Usage - Version without GUI
-Navigate to the "dist" folder and launch the .exe
-Enter your first guess against the wordle website and observe the returned color of each letter

-When prompted, enter your returned letters by color into the command prompt. Ensure that the letter placement matches the returned letter placement

--i.e. if the guess was "crate" and the "r" returned as yellow, ensure that you enter " r   " when prompted for yellow letters
